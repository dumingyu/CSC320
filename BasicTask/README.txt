This project includes one Python file:
Project.py
(the description of each function is included in Project.py as comments, please check there if needed).

In this program, we first transfer the Sudoku to SATinput, then solving the Sudoku by transferring from SAToutput. Then print the solutions to terminal.

Compile:
	The following is command in the terminal:
		python Project.py test1.txt
		python Project.py test2.txt
		python Project.py test3.txt
		python Project.py test4.txt
		­...........................
		...........................
		...........................
		python Project.py test50.txt


then, we can get the solution of each grid.

Note: after we test the test1.txt, we have two files named in and out, respectively in the same directory where the project.py stored. 
Therefore, if you continue test the remaining test files. The previous in and out files are gone and replaced by new in and out files produce by new test.
